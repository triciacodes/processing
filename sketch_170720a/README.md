Learning how to create 3D shapes. After I figured out that I couldn't make a gradient for a 3D shape, I tried recreating it with a for loop. The iterator on the boxes was intentional, but the color was a happy accident. I'm still not sure exactly what is happening with the color, and I intend to figure that out later.
