# Processing Sketches

Saving some of my Processing sketches while I learn. Updating a log below.

Building out my [sketch from 7/20](https://github.com/tricialeach/processing/tree/master/sketch_170720a) to work on moving objects around in 3D space with translate.

### [7/20/2017](https://github.com/tricialeach/processing/tree/master/sketch_170720a)

Learning how to create 3D shapes. After I figured out that I couldn't make a gradient for a 3D shape, I tried recreating it with a for loop. The iterator on the boxes was intentional, but the color was a happy accident. I'm still not sure exactly what is happening with the color, and I intend to figure that out later.
